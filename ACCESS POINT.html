                <p>A network switch (also called switching hub,
                    bridging hub, 
                    and, by the IEEE, MAC bridge[1])
                     is networking hardware 
                    that connects devices on a
                     computer network by using packet switching
                      to receive and forward data
                      to the destination device.
                  A network switch is a multiport network bridge 
                    that uses MAC addresses to forward
                     data at the data link layer (layer 2) 
                    of the OSI model. Some switches can also forward
                     data at the network layer 
                    (layer 3) by additionally incorporating 
                    routing functionality. 
                    Such switches are commonly known 
                    as layer-3 switches or multilayer switches</p>

                What is a wireless access point?<br>
A wireless access point (WAP) is a networking device<br>
that allows wireless-capable devices to connect to a wired network.<br> 
It is simpler and easier to install WAPs to connect<br>
all the computers or devices in your network than to use wires and cables.<br>
Why use a WAP to set up a wireless network?<br>
Using a WAP lets you create a wireless network within<br>
your existing wired network, so you can accommodate wireless devices.<br>
You can also use a WAP or mesh extenders to extend the<br> 
signal range and strength of your wireless network to provide complete<br>
wireless coverage and get rid of "dead spots," especially in larger<br> 
office spaces or buildings. Additionally, you can configure the settings of<br>
 your WAPs using a single device.

Common types of access point configurations<br>
Root access point
In this configuration, an access point is connected directly<br>
 to a wired LAN, providing a connection point for wireless <br>
 users. If more than one access point is connected to the LAN, users<br> 
 can roam from one area of a facility to another without losing their network connection.<br>
Repeater access point<br>
An access point or mesh extender can be configured as a standalone<br> 
repeater to extend the range of your infrastructure or overcome an obstacle <br>
that blocks radio communication.
The repeater forwards traffic between wireless users and the wired network<br>
 by sending data to either another repeater or an access point that is connected<br>
 to the wired network. The data is sent through the route that provides the best<br>
 performance for the client.
Bridges
Access points can be configured as root or non-root bridges to join multiple<br>
networks. An access point in this role will establish a wireless link with<br>
a non-root bridge. Traffic is then passed over the wireless link to the wired network.<br>
Workgroup bridge
Access points that are in workgroup bridge mode can<br>
"associate" to other access points as clients and provide <br>
network connections for devices connected to Ethernet ports.<br>
For example, if your business needs wireless connectivity <br>
for a group of network printers, you can connect the <br>
printers to a hub or a switch, connect the hub or switch<br>
to the access point Ethernet port, and configure the access<br>
point as a workgroup bridge. The workgroup bridge will then<br> 
"associate" to an access point on your network.<br>
Central unit in an all-wireless network<br>
In an all-wireless network, an access point acts as a<br>
standalone root unit. It is not attached to a wired LAN.<br> 
Instead, the access point functions as a hub that links all<br>
 stations together. It serves as the focal point for<br> 
 communications, increasing the communication range of wireless users.<br>
Key benefits of upgrading to WAPs<br>
WAPs are a more convenient, secure, and cost-efficient alternative to<br>
using wires and cables to connect every computer or device in your network.<br>
And using WAPs to set up a wireless network can provide many advantages and<br> 
benefits for your small business.
For one, a wireless network is more convenient to access. Adding new<br>
users is a lot less complicated, too. And you can easily provide Internet access to<br>
guest users by giving them a password to access your wireless network securely.<br>
Also you can easily segment users, including guests, to help protect your network resources and assets.<br>
Preparation for the future
When you invest in WAPs that feature future-ready modularity, you are helping to<br>
ready your IT infrastructure to support next-generation technologies.<br>
WAPs that meet the new Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) standard, for example, can help you<br>
 build a reliable, scalable, and secure wireless network to handle the rapidly growing number of<br>
 Internet of Things (IoT) devices—and the data that those devices will create.<br>

<p style="color:blue;">My mind to me a kingdom is<br>
Such present joys therein I find,<br>
That it excels all other bliss<br>
That earth affords or grows by kind:<br>
Though much I want that most would have,<br>
Yet still my mind forbids to crave<br>
This poem has been popular with readers ever since<br>
it was first published<br>
in 1588 in William Byrd’s Psalmes, Sonets, & Songs<br>
Yet the authorship of ‘My mind to me a kingdom<br>
is by no means certain, and some anthologists now prefer to credit<br>
Edward de Vere, the Seventeenth Earl of Oxford, with<br>
authorship rather than Dyer. Whoever wrote it<br>
it’s an inspiring Renaissance poem<br>
about the power of ‘mind over matter<br>
and the wonders of the human imagination</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier;">The WWW is more and more used for application to application communication. The programmatic<br>
interfaces made available are referred to as web services. Most people today can hardly conceive of<br>
life without the internet. The web of documents has morphed into a web of data. The semantic<br>
wave embraces three stages of internet growth. The first stage, web 1.0, was about connecting<br>
information and getting on the net. Web 2.0 is about connecting people putting the “I” in user<br>
interface, and the “we” into a web of social participation. The next stage, web 3.0, is starting now.<br>
It is about representing meanings, connecting knowledge, and putting them to work in ways that<br>
make our experience of internet more relevant, useful, and enjoyable</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">A web service is a software system designed to support computer-to-computer interaction over<br>
the Internet. Web services are not new and usually take the form of an Application Programming<br>
Interface (API). In today’s world of extreme competition on the business front, information<br>
exchange and efficient communication is the need of the day. The web is an increasingly important<br>
resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care<br>
recreation, and more. The web is a system of interlinked, hypertext documents accessed via the<br>
Internet. With a web browser, a user views web pages that may contain text, images, videos<br>
other multimedia and navigates between them using hyperlinks</p>

<p style="font-size:50px;">The web was created in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, working at CERN (The European Organization<br>
for Nuclear Research) in Geneva, Switzerland. Since then, Berners-Lee has played an active role<br>
in guiding the development of web standards (such as the markup languages in which web pages<br>
are composed), in recent years has advocated his vision of a Semantic web<br>
Web 1.0 was the era when people could think that Netscape was the contender for the computer<br>
industry crown. Web 2.0 is the era when people have come to realize that it’s not the software<br>
that enables the web that matters so much as the services that are delivered over the web<br>
technologies will make online search more intelligent and may even lead to a web 3.0. Enter<br>
web 2.0, a vision of the web in which information is broken up into “microcontent” units that can</p>

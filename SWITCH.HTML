                <p>A network switch (also called switching hub, 
                    bridging hub, 
                    and, by the IEEE, MAC bridge[1])
                     is networking hardware 
                    that connects devices on a
                     computer network by using packet switching
                      to receive and forward data
                      to the destination device.
                  A network switch is a multiport network bridge 
                    that uses MAC addresses to forward
                     data at the data link layer (layer 2) 
                    of the OSI model. Some switches can also forward
                     data at the network layer 
                    (layer 3) by additionally incorporating 
                    routing functionality. 
                    Such switches are commonly known 
                    as layer-3 switches or multilayer switches</p>

              <p class="para">Why are network switches valuable?<br>
                Switches are responsible for relaying information<br>
                between different endpoints and offer a plethora of benefits:<br>
                
                Switches form the majority of network devices in modern data<br>
                networks and carry huge amounts of traffic in telecommunications provider networks.<br>
                They offer full-duplex communication, connect network segments,<br> 
                boost network performance and make effective use of available bandwidth.<br>
                Switches provide the wired connections to desktop computers, <br>
                wireless access points (APs), printers, industrial machinery <br>
                and some internet of things (IoT) devices, such as card entry systems.<br>
                They connect the computers that host virtual machines (VMs) in <br>
                data centers, as well as physical servers and much of the storage infrastructure.<br>
                Most modern switches employ the Power over Ethernet <br>
                technology, which can deliver up to 100 watts of<br> 
                power to support the connectivity of network devices.<br> 
                This enables businesses to set up equipment like outdoor lighting,<br> 
                security cameras, voice over IP phones and various kinds of sensors for <br>
                monitoring remote areas in locations where a separate power source<br>
                 is not necessary.
                Data from IoT devices can be collected by a network switch and used by<br>
                artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to optimize smarter surroundings.<br>
                How does a network switch work?
                All switches transmit data from one location to another, but their<br> 
                hardware and software configurations can vary greatly. A network switch can be deployed<br>                 in the following ways:
                
                Edge, or access, switches. These switches manage traffic either coming into or<br>
                exiting the network. Devices like computers and APs connect to edge switches.<br>
                Aggregation, or distribution, switches. These switches are placed within an optional<br>
                middle layer in a network topology. Edge switches connect into these and send traffic<br> 
                from switch to switch or send it up to core switches.<br>
                Core switches. These network switches form the backbone of the network. Core switches<br>
                connect aggregation or edge switches, users or device edge networks to<br>
                data center networks and enterprise LANs to routers.<br>
                A data frame is flooded to all ports in the switching domain<br>
                if it is forwarded to a MAC address that the switch infrastructure is not familiar with.<br>
                 Data frames for multicast and broadcast are also flooded. This is known as broadcast,<br> 
                 unknown unicast and multicast flooding. This capability makes a switch<br>
                  a Layer 2 device in the OSI communications model.</p><br>
